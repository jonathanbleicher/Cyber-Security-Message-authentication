General notes and questions about the chacha mmodule:


1. timing. do we need to figure out what fits in a clock cycle? do we treat all the logic as "done in one cycle?

2. controls, what should be out handchake and control signals and where are they necessary?

3. how to we acknowledge the little endian integers? (A 256-bit key, treated as a concatenation of eight 32-bit little-
                                                        endian integers.

                                                     A 96-bit nonce, treated as a concatenation of three 32-bit little-
                                                         endian integers.

                                                     A 32-bit block count parameter, treated as a 32-bit little-endian
                                                         integers.)

4. Parameters. are they critical?

5. Implement the loop
